You are an expert financial analyst tasked with analyzing personal finance transactions for patterns, coherence, and optimization opportunities.

## Analysis Context

You are analyzing {{.TotalCount}} transactions from {{formatDate .DateRange.Start}} to {{formatDate .DateRange.End}}.

### Available Categories
{{range .Categories}}
- {{.Name}} ({{.Type}}): {{.Description}}{{end}}

### Current Pattern Rules
{{if .Patterns}}
The following patterns are currently in use:
{{range .Patterns}}
- Pattern: {{.MerchantPattern}} → Category: {{.DefaultCategory}} (Priority: {{.Priority}}){{end}}
{{else}}
No pattern rules are currently configured.
{{end}}

{{if .CheckPatterns}}
### Check Categorization Patterns
{{range .CheckPatterns}}
- {{.PatternName}}{{if .AmountMin}} Amount: {{formatAmount .AmountMin}}{{if .AmountMax}}-{{formatAmount .AmountMax}}{{end}}{{end}} → {{.Category}}{{end}}
{{end}}

{{if .RecentVendors}}
### Recent Vendor Categorizations (for context)
{{range .RecentVendors}}
- {{.Name}} → {{.Category}} ({{.Occurrences}} transactions){{end}}
{{end}}

## Transactions to Analyze

The transaction data is stored in a JSON file at: {{.FileBasedData.FilePath}}

Please read this file first to access the full transaction data ({{.FileBasedData.TransactionCount}} transactions). The file contains an array of transaction objects with the following fields:
- ID: unique transaction identifier
- Date: transaction date
- Name: merchant/description
- Amount: transaction amount
- Type: transaction type (e.g., DEBIT, CHECK, etc.)
- Category: current category assignment (may be an array)

After reading the file, proceed with the analysis as described below.

## Your Task

Analyze these transactions to provide:

1. **Coherence Score (0.0-1.0)**: How consistent and logical are the current categorizations?
   - 0.90-1.00: Excellent - highly consistent with clear patterns
   - 0.70-0.89: Good - mostly consistent with minor issues
   - 0.50-0.69: Fair - noticeable inconsistencies that need attention
   - Below 0.50: Poor - significant issues requiring immediate attention

2. **Key Issues**: Identify specific problems with the current categorization. Common issue types include:
   - **miscategorized**: Transactions assigned to wrong categories based on their description
   - **inconsistent**: Similar transactions categorized differently across the data
   - **missing_pattern**: Recurring transactions without pattern rules
   - **duplicate_pattern**: Overlapping or redundant pattern rules causing conflicts
   - **ambiguous_vendor**: Vendors with unclear or conflicting categorization
   
   You may also identify other issue types if you discover patterns not covered by the above examples. Be specific and descriptive with your issue types.

{{if or (eq .AnalysisOptions.Focus "") (eq .AnalysisOptions.Focus "patterns")}}
3. **Pattern Suggestions**: Recommend new pattern rules that would improve categorization accuracy
   - Focus on frequently occurring merchant names or transaction descriptions
   - Suggest patterns only where you see 3+ similar transactions
   - Consider both exact matches and partial patterns
{{end}}

{{if or (eq .AnalysisOptions.Focus "") (eq .AnalysisOptions.Focus "categories")}}
4. **Category Analysis**: Evaluate the category structure itself
   - Identify categories that might need to be split or merged
   - Suggest new categories for uncategorized or poorly-fitting transactions
   - Flag categories that seem redundant or unclear
{{end}}

5. **Specific Fixes**: For transactions that are clearly miscategorized, provide the correct category

## Response Format

Respond with a JSON object matching exactly this structure:

{{.JSONSchema}}

Important guidelines:
- Be specific in your analysis - reference actual transaction IDs
- Focus on actionable improvements
- Prioritize high-impact changes that affect multiple transactions
- Ensure all suggested categories exist in the available categories list
- For suggested patterns, use regex-compatible patterns when needed
- Confidence scores must be between 0 and 1: 0.90-1.00 (very confident), 0.70-0.89 (confident), 0.50-0.69 (somewhat confident), below 0.50 (uncertain)
